# This is all about the project
# It is a data analysis project of an E-Commerce Purchase Worksheet. The main objective of the project is to analyze the parameters in order to get meaningful insights regarding E-Commerce sale. The insight will help to understand the intensity of product purchasing at a certain time (day or night). The professions of the customers are added in the worksheet which would help the respective E-Commerce site to understand the taste of the customer and based on that they can endorse that particular product as per the profession. For an example if somebody is associated to engineering or technical profession then he will get the advertisement of the engineering products such as drill machine, welding machine, engineering handbook, wrench and so on. In this way the E-Commerce organizations can understand the requirements of the customers which thereby enhance the profitability.
